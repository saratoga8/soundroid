---- To install the compiled agent:
    - upack the downloaded file
    - copy all the shared libraries files *.so from the lib directory to the system's directory for libraries(/usr/lib, /lib or /lib64)
    - run the daemon from the build directory by command line or by gui.
	E.g. for running the daemon in wifi mode listening the port 5000:
		cd build
		./vol_daemon wifi 5000
	E.g. for running the daemon in bluetooth mode:
		cd build
		./vol_daemon bt
       E.g. for running the daemon from gui:
		cd build
		./gui

    - to stop the daemon in command line:
	cd build
	./stop.sh

---- To install the agent from source code:
For building should be used the compiler gcc-4.* and g++-4.*

The project uses ALSA for controlling sound volume, then the ALSA's source code should be installed.
    E.g. for Ubuntu the package libasound2-dev should be installed

Connecting from an Android device to the daemon implemented by Wifi or Bluetooth, then
for Bluetooth connection build should be installed the package libbluetooth-dev

For building only daemon without GUI program:
    make
    make install        (as root)
The last command copy the built dynamic libraries from the local directory to the directory of 
system libraries, which is in the project /usr/lib by default.
If on your system the system libraries directory is not /usr/lib, the variable SYS_LIBS_DIR in
Makefile should be changed to the system libraries directory of your system.

For buiding GUI program, the GTK+-3 should be installed with source codes.
E.g. for Ubuntu the package libgtk-3-dev should be installed
For building from source code:
    make gui
