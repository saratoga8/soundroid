This project is for volume control of a desktop(laptop) from an Android device

	Features:
		- control the desktop's sound volume from Android device by WiFi and Bluetooth
		- saving controlled desktops names in Android device
		- the project is open source and FREE for using and changing

	Requires:
		- Linux system: with ALSA support and Gnome(only for using the GUI daemon control program), 
		  		Bluetooth support(only for using Bluetooth connection)
		- Android device with WiFi(The minimal Android version 2.2)

	The project consists of two parts: 	
		- The Android application Soundroid from the Google Play
		- The Linux daemon and the program for controlling the daemon(GUI), for connecting with the Android application.
		  The daemon can be run standalone or as a task of scheduler(e.g. cron or fcron)

For desktop volume control from Android by Wifi, the desktop and the Android device should be connected to the same router and
selected port shouldn't be in use by other application or program

For desktop volume control from Android by Bluetooth, the desktop and the Android device should be paired by bluetooth manager
e.g. blueman - the bluetooth manager for Linux

The structure of the project:
    
    Source code directories:
	Gui           - The gui program for controlling volume daemon: change port, restart, stop and etc.
	Log           - The dynamic library for writing logs of the volume daemon
	MsgsQueue     - The library for sending/receiving messages between processes(e.g. between gui and daemon)
	SoundLib      - The library for controlling sound volume by ALSA
	Utils         - Utils for work with files, strings etc.
	net/wifi      - The library for connecting to the daemon by wifi
	net/bluetooth - The library for connecting to the daemon by bluetooth

	scripts - contains script for stopping the running daemon

	headers - header files for the daemon(commands, connectors)
	src - source files for the daemon(commands, connectors)

	config.file - configuration file for doxygen
	Makefile - the main make file
